# Document

## Overview

Build documents as durable written communication. Treat DOCX, Markdown, PDF, and
plain text as delivery routes selected by audience, review workflow, fidelity,
and layout risk.

## Route

1. Identify the job: create, rewrite, edit, review, redline, comment, inspect,
   summarize, convert, or package for handoff.
2. Extract audience, decision or reader action, source materials, required
   claims, approval constraints, template/style constraints, and review path.
3. Choose an archetype and form-factor plan before drafting. For new documents
   or major rewrites, read `references/document-system.md`.
4. If the user supplied a DOCX, inspect it before editing with
   `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/docx_tool.py inspect path/to/file.docx --out report.json`
   when useful. Preserve existing template conventions unless the user requests a redesign.
5. Create a document plan before writing. If emitting JSON, keep it compatible
   with `{baseDir}/assets/schemas/document-plan.schema.json`.
6. Choose the output route:
   - Use Markdown for fast drafts, reviewable structure, and agent-friendly iteration.
   - Use DOCX when the user needs Word compatibility, comments, tracked-change workflows, exact table/list behavior, or template preservation.
   - Use PDF only for fixed-layout delivery or handouts after the source document is stable.
7. Build or edit with the route's intended tools:
   - For DOCX creation, editing, comments, redlines, or template preservation, first prefer a real DOCX library, office automation, or host document tool available in the task environment. If the required package or command is missing, verify that absence and try to install or enable it in the local task environment when permissions allow.
   - Do not silently downgrade an explicit DOCX/Word request to Markdown, plain text, or PDF, and do not hand-author WordprocessingML ZIP packages as a substitute for a missing DOCX library unless the user approves that lower-level route or no install path is available and you state the limitation.
   - Prefer bundled scripts for deterministic structure checks; use richer host rendering/conversion tools only when they preserve the same verification discipline.
8. Verify before delivering. At minimum check source fidelity, heading structure,
   placeholders, local assets, tables, comments/redlines, and render/open limits.

## References

Load only the reference needed for the current route:

- `references/workflow.md` for planning, source mapping, and delivery flow.
- `references/document-system.md` for archetypes, design presets, form factors, tone, hierarchy, and table gates.
- `references/docx-operations.md` for DOCX package inspection, comments, tracked changes, OOXML risks, and template preservation.
- `references/verification.md` for source-fidelity, structural, and format QA.

## Scripts

- `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/docx_tool.py inspect file.docx --out report.json` inspects DOCX package structure, headings, sections, tables, comments, tracked changes, relationships, media, headers/footers, notes, manual bullets, and placeholder-like text.
- `node {baseDir}/scripts/markdown_tool.mjs inspect draft.md --out report.json` inspects Markdown/HTML-like drafts for headings, hierarchy jumps, long paragraphs, tables, local asset references, remote dependencies, and placeholder-like text.

The scripts are portable baseline tools. Do not assume product-specific tools
exist. If a host offers richer DOCX rendering, PDF export, visual QA, comments,
or redline tooling, use it and keep the same final verification discipline. If
the requested DOCX route requires a missing library or office command, follow the
skill-dependency rule before changing formats.

## Quality Bar

- Do not deliver generic prose when the user provided concrete source material.
- Make the document's purpose obvious from the title, opening, and section order.
- Pick document archetype and form factors deliberately; do not use tables as decorative layout boxes.
- Preserve factual source fidelity; label inferences and assumptions.
- Keep headings parallel and useful for skimming.
- Keep Word semantics real: headings are heading styles, lists are numbering definitions, tables have deliberate geometry, comments/redlines are intentional.
- Do not leave placeholders, TODOs, unresolved comments, or accidental tracked changes unless the user asked for them.
- State limitations plainly when rendering, DOCX editing, or visual verification is unavailable.
