# PPTX Operations

PPTX files are ZIP packages of XML parts, relationships, media, charts, notes,
layouts, masters, and content types. Treat them as structured packages, not as
single files.

## Inspect First

Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/pptx_tool.py inspect input.pptx --out report.json
```

Read the report for:

- slide count and slide order
- missing relationship targets
- media/chart/notes references
- slide layouts and masters
- placeholder-like text
- hidden or unusual package parts

## Template Editing

When using an existing deck as a template:

1. Render or inspect thumbnails if possible.
2. Identify layout families: cover, section, image-led, comparison, process, stat, quote, chart, closing.
3. Map new content to existing layouts.
4. Duplicate or remove whole slide/group structures deliberately.
5. Replace content after structural edits.
6. Clean unused placeholders and orphaned assets.
7. Repack and verify.

## Package Risks

Common failure modes:

- slide exists but is not in `ppt/presentation.xml`
- slide relationship missing from `ppt/_rels/presentation.xml.rels`
- media/chart target referenced but absent
- `[Content_Types].xml` missing an override
- notes or comments copied with stale relationships
- placeholder text left in hidden groups
- text overflow visible only after rendering

## Generation Notes

If generating PPTX with a library:

- set slide size explicitly
- use real list paragraphs, not pasted bullet characters
- keep images in stable aspect-ratio boxes
- do not rely on default theme colors
- verify by opening, converting, or rendering when possible

If the user explicitly requested PPTX and reliable PPTX generation is not
available, do not silently switch formats. First verify the missing dependency
or command, then install or enable an appropriate PPTX library/tool in the local
task environment when permissions allow. If that is blocked, ask before
delivering HTML, PDF, a slide plan, or a hand-authored OOXML package instead.
State the compatibility and verification gap clearly.

Hand-authored OOXML is a last-resort repair or packaging route, not the default
creation route. Use it only when an existing PPTX/template must be patched at the
package level, or when the user accepts the lower-level route after the normal
PPTX tool path is blocked.
